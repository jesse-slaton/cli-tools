    # Initializes the CodeQL tools for scanning.
    # KNOWN LIMITATION: Rust only supports build-mode 'none', which produces a "Low Rust analysis
    # quality" warning due to limited macro expansion (~32% vs 50% threshold). This may cause:
    # - Missed vulnerabilities in macro-heavy code (serde, tokio, procedural macros)
    # - False positives in complex unsafe blocks
    # No workaround exists. Consider supplementing with cargo-audit and cargo-deny for dependencies.
